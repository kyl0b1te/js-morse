# jsmorse

Node.js library for work with morse code.
In was made with an idea (not the best one as I see it now) "let's keep it as functional as possible".

The main idea of the project was to show some parallels between binary numbers and morse code.
And how easily binary numbers can be used for morse code representation.

## Documentation

There a lot of methods in the `Morse` class.
Unfortunately we cannot have a real private methods in JS at that moment.
Let's stop only on public one here:

- `encode(text: string) :string` - converts plain text to morse code.

- `decode(code: string) :string` - converts morse code to plain text.

## Summary

I cannot find a reason for continue making improvements here.
So I consider it as finished.
